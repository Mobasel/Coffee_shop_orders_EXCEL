In this Excel project, I analyzed the coffee shop orders for the years 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022.
In this project, I used the functions V-lookup, x-lookup, index & match, and If in the highlighted part of the sheet in the following screenshot.

Also, I created a pivot table to get the total sales per coffee type for each month.
Then, I inserted some charts for better visualization and combined them in a new sub-sheet.
