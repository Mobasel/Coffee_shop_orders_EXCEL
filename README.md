In this Excel project, I analyzed the coffee shop orders for the years 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022.            
In this project, I used the functions V-lookup, x-lookup, index & match, and If to pull the data from other sheets. you will find that in the highlighted part of the sheet in the below screenshot.        
Also, I created a pivot table to get the total sales per coffee type for each month.                        
Then, I inserted some charts for better visualization and combined them in a new sub-sheet.                      
And, finally, I took the resultant sheet to Tableau to get the maximum benefits of the visualization and created a dashboard.
